Keeps most part of the custodial coins, controls the minting limitation.- The saving account and keeper can run in a computer running full-node inside firewall, under the admin of a more trustworthy team (such as the coin official team), so: If our checking account got hacked, or we “exit-scam”, coins in the saving account can still keep.
